Project im working on to create a website that shows my achievements in both academics and real world work experience.
Includes a resume, about me, contact page, etc. 

FOR FUTURE UPDATES: 
I plan to overhaul the entire website soon once I can apply all the concepts I learned in Web Development Course at the U.
I will try to apply key concepts and technologies learned such as Django, HTML Templates, Authentication and Authorization, CSS Styling, Flexbox Design, JavaSript and more.
